# Birary-Search-in-Python(Recursive and Iterative approach)

Binary search is effective mainly due to the reduction of list dimension with each recursive function call or iteration. A practical implementation of binary search is autocompletion.

# Python Binary Search Algorithm:
The objective of this project is to create a simple python program to implement binary search. It can be implemented in two ways: recursive (function calls) and iterative.

# Project Prerequisites:
The project uses loops and functions to implement the search function.

# Project File Structure:

1. Recursive approach

Function definition
Read inputs, sort and call function
2. Iterative approach

Read inputs and sort
Loop for binary search
